/* We can now take as much input from the user as we want, but we can still only
 * store a limited number of numbers at any one time.  In this chapter we will
 * introduce vectors, which allow for storing an arbitrary number of values.
 * They are, in a way, similar to strings, which allow you to store as many
 * characters as you want.
 *
 * A vector can store any of the types we named before, but any particular
 * vector must store only objects of one type.  We can specify what type this is
 * when we declare the vector.  For example, if we'd like v to be a vector that
 * stores ints, we say
 *
 *      std::vector<int> v;
 *
 * Once a vector is declared to store things of a certain type, we can not
 * change it to store something else.  On the bright side, this means that given
 * a vector we always know what type of things it contains.
 * Vectors can be used to store all the type of basic data types.
 * 
 *      std::vector<TYPE> v;
 *
 * We can also use vectors to store other vectors. We also have
 *
 *      v.size() // the number of elements in the vector
 *      v.empty() // whether the vector is empty
 *      v[0] // the first element
 *      v[1] // the second element
 *      ... // etc.
 *
 * As an example, we'll write a program that reads as many numbers as the user
 * provides, and then finds the index of the greatest and least elements.
