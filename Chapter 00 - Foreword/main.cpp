/* Hi!  This is a multi-line comment.  I'm terrible at doing any kind of web

 * available online, so I decided to do what I usually do with C++: make a
 * Github repository and write C++ programs.  Just reading the programs would
 * probably be too confusing to learn the language, so I added lots of comments
 * to explain what's going on.

 * Like this one.

/* I decided to call this "book" Linear C++, because most people believe you
 * can't learn C++ in a linear fashion, and I disagree.  I think existing
 * resources, particularly online ones, just teach things in entirely the wrong
 * order.  They focus a lot on the low-level bits and the syntax and never show
 * you how the whole thing fits together as one language, and how you can write
 * useful programs in it with little pain.  Relatively little pain, anyway.

/* I will do my best to introduce all the concepts I use properly, without
 * having to resort to claims about magic.  However, there are a few things
 * which you really do have to know first.  I expect you to have already worked
 * in another programming language and to know how arithmetic operators such as
 * +, -, *, / and comparison operators such as ==, !=, <, <=, >, >= work.  I
 * also expect you to have a vague idea of what functions, types and variables
 * are. If you have little idea about these, you will do fine, we will learn 
 * through the use of these very frequently. 
 * Finally, I'll be using fairly new features wherever they are useful, so
 * make sure your compiler can handle that.  Clang is probably the most friendly
 * compiler, but GCC or MSVC should be fine, too.
 *
 * There's a number of tutorials online about setting up your compiler.  I like
 * the ones at http://latedev.wordpress.com , but there are others if you'd like
 * to use an IDE not covered there.  Dev-C++ is not recommended due to being
 * outdated.  If you want to read more about the C++ language or standard
 * library, http://en.cppreference.com/w/ has articles on almost everything.
 *
 * If you have any questions, feel free to submit an issue on

/* A note to those with experience in C: while C++ does allow a significant
 * portion of C, good solutions in C often aren't particularly good solutions in
 * C++.  I suggest working through the material without resorting to any tricks
 * you learned in C.  In particular when it comes to exceptions, we'll see that
 * the problems and solutions that result interact poorly with C-style code.
 */

/* Every chapter of the book is a correct program.  This is only the foreword,
 * but it would be a pity to make it an exception, so we'll make it a program
 * that does nothing.

// A function called main, taking no parameters and returning an int.
int main() {
    return 0;
}

/* main is a very special function.  It is the starting point of your program,
 * and its return value can be used to report if any errors happened.  A return
 * value of 0 traditionally indicates success, and is what we will return in
 * most cases.
 * You might have seen beginners using void main, but The ANSI standard says "no"
 * to the 'void main' and thus using it can be considered wrong. 
 * One should stop using the 'void main' if doing so.
